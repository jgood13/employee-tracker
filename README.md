# Employee-tracker

## Description

This is a terminal application for creating and managing a database of employees. I'm using SQL, Inquirer, console.table, and asciiart-logo to create a series of prompts which allows you to view, edit, add, and delete departments, roles, and employees.

## How to use
To use this application you must first do install npm and mysql2. Then you must run the program in node, when done you will get a list of prompts to choose from. You are able to view,add, and delete departments and roles. You are also able to view, add, edit, or delete employees. When you choose to add or edit you will be given prompts with which your input will be required to create names/titles/etc.

## Resources used
1. mysql2
2. inquirer
3. console.table
4. asciiart-logo
